Concept

Filter takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence for which the function returned True. A Lambda function can be used with filters. 

Lets say you have to make a list of squares of integers from 0 to 9 (both included).

l = list(range(10))
l = list(map(lambda x:x*x, l))


Now you only require those elements which are greater than 10 and less than 80.

l = list(filter(lambda x: x > 10 and x < 80, l))

Easy isn't it!
